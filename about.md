# About the Project


## Team
**Project Lead:** Izzy B.
**Systems & Architecture:** Kush
**Neural Networks & Edge Computing:** Team Member
**Simulation & Integration:** Team Member


## Sponsor
This project is sponsored by a U.S. Navy-affiliated research partner focused on advancing **low-cost UAV spoofing platforms and real-time spoof detection methods**.


## Mission
The mission is to improve awareness of sensor spoofing threats while developing a practical testbed for neural network-based detection strategies in UAV systems.


## Scope
- Virtual sensor generation and spoof injection
- Embedded AI for real-time classification
- FAA-compliant UAV testing environments
- Modular system architecture for future research
