## Sponsor
This project is sponsored by a U.S. Navy-affiliated research partner focused on advancing **low-cost UAV spoofing platforms and real-time spoof detection methods**.


## Mission
The mission is to improve awareness of sensor spoofing threats while developing a practical testbed for neural network-based detection strategies in UAV systems.


## Scope
- Virtual sensor generation and spoof injection
- Embedded AI for real-time classification
- Emulated done flight and esting environments
- Modular system architecture for future research
