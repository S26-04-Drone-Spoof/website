# UAV Sensor Spoofing Detection Platform


This project develops a **real-time, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test platform** for simulating and detecting spoofed UAV sensor data. The system combines a virtual sensing environment, a real-time middleware bridge, and an onboard neural network to evaluate how LiDAR, GPS, and multi-sensor data can be manipulated and reliably identified in adversarial conditions.


## Project Goals
- Simulate realistic and adversarial UAV sensor environments
- Generate spoofed and authentic LiDAR/GPS data streams
- Detect spoofing using embedded neural networks
- Support SIL and HIL validation workflows
- Provide scalable, low-cost research platform


## System Overview
The platform integrates:
- **Unreal Engine 5** for virtual LiDAR generation and spoofing
- **Simulink Bridge** for real-time data synchronization
- **UAV Edge Device (Jetson)** for neural inference
- **Ground Control Station** for configuration and monitoring
